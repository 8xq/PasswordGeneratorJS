# PasswordGeneratorJS
This is a very basic example of a "password generator" made with Javascript , I am learning JS and this was a very good starting project.                                              
I will soon be adding a "length" input & some more options for the password generation.


## Features
* Random uppercase character
* Random lowercase character
* Random number (0-9)
* Random special character
